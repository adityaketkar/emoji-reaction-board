<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Video calls are great, but most time majority of people are **silent observers** ðŸ™Š.

Too many people talking seems chaotic, and too many incoming video streams give your **internet connection a hard time**. 

For the speaker, this feels like **talking to a wall** and makes it hard to figure out the audience response. Even if someone wants to respond, there's a **awkward silence** before they unmute and start to talk. Which leaves us tinkering on the idea ðŸ’¡ : <br>

**How can we make it easier for people to quickly and frequently pitch in without turning on voice / video ?**

This hackathon projects picks on the idea of making a dashboard for Audience and Speaker with preset states and responses. 

Audience can register their responce and state frequently, without any speed drops and Speaker can get continous feedback from audience and ask interactive questions.
